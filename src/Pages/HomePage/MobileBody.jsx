A 2 player game is played with 1 deck (52+1 Cards), and a game with more than 2 players is played with 2 decks. All the players are dealt with 10 cards, which they have to meld into sequences and sets. 3 types of games can be played in 10 Cards Rummy; Point, Pool &amp; Deals. <br /> <br /> <span className="strong"><a href="/13-cards-rummy">13 Cards Rummy:</a></span><br /> 13 Cards Rummy is a traditional version of Indian Rummy game played between 2 to 6 Players with 2 decks of cards at KhelPlay Rummy. 13 cards each are dealt to every player in a 13 Card Rummy game, 12 of which have to be melded into Sequences and Sets. Apart from 2 Printed Jokers, 13 Card Rummy also makes use of 8 Wildcard Jokers. What makes 13 Card Rummy so popular among Rummy Players is the fact that it is easy to play and can be enjoyed in its different variants â€“ Pool, Deals and Points. <br /> <br /> <span className="strong"><a href="/pool-rummy">Pool Rummy:</a> </span><br /> Pool Rummy consists of two types â€“ 101 and 201. The basic premise of the 101 Pool Rummy Game is that the first Player to reach 101 Points loses, while in the 201 Pool Rummy Game the first Player to reach 201 Points loses. Players continually attempt to meld their cards into Sequences and Sets and reduce their number of points so as to avoid the danger mark. What makes the game more exciting is the provision for Players to Re-Buy the Game after losing, which is applicable when the highest score is less than 79 points in case of 101 Rummy and less than 174 Points in 201 Rummy Game. The facility for the Pot to be Split among Players through Auto Split and Manual Split options is another one of the interesting aspects of 101 and 201 Rummy Game. Manual Split allows 2 or more Players to share the Spoils on a Multiplayer (3 or more) Table while Auto Split gets triggered when 2 or more players have scores of more than 80 and 175 in a 101 Rummy and 201 Rummy Multiplayer Game respectively. <br /> <br /> <span className="strong"><a href="/deal-rummy">Deals Rummy</a>: </span><br /> Deals Rummy is a commonly played rummy variant which consists of a fixed number of Deals. Depending on the number of Deals involved, Deals Rummy Game can be classified into the Best of 6 (BO6) or Best of 3 (BO3) or Best of 2 (BO2) types. In both of these variants, irrespective of the number of rounds won, the one to score minimum points upon completion of either 6 rounds in BO6 or 3 rounds in BO3 or 2 rounds in BO2 is declared winner. And in case of a Tie between 2 or more Players, an extra Tiebreaker Round would be played to decide the Winner. <br /> <br /> <span className="strong"><a href="/point-rummy">Points Rummy</a>: </span><br /> Points Rummy is a popular Rummy Variant which consists of only one deal per game and where the value of points is predetermined. Players get to choose between different Point Games ranging in point value between 0.05 and 125 in this fast-paced and highly entertaining Rummy format. In any Point Game, the winner gets an amount equal to the combined score of all the losing players multiplied by the point value minus the rake*. <br /> <br /> Both 13 Cards Rummy and 21 Cards Rummy can be played in the Points format. <br /> <br /> <span className="strong"><a href="/21-card-rummy">21 Cards Rummy</a>:</span> <br /> 21 Cards Rummy is a popular variant of Indian Rummy game which is commonly played across India and is available in its Desktop Version at KhelPlay Rummy.
